You've asked and we've listened, our latest mvp has the ability for you to create roles for your SSO integration.


Quick Steps:
1. Create your integration
2. When it is complete, create roles (client level) for the respective environments
3. Add users to the roles
4. Configure our app to make use of these roles that are passed via the access token/payload

A couple of notes

1. A Role can only be created if the integration has been successfully completed by the CSS App

1. A Role can be added to environment(s) only if the environment defined for the integration

1. A Role list auto loaded if the environment has more than 20 roles

1. Select a role and the right hand side will show users assigned to the role

1. Delete a role also remove  the role from users assigned with the role....its on our backlog to allow to delete one user at a time

1. Integration Team (member or admin) can create OR delete roles

1. Integration Team (member or admin) can see all users assigned to role
